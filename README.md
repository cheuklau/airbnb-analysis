## Motivation

In this project, we examine the Seattle Airbnb [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) in order to gain insight into factors that affect the popularity of a listing. In particular, we want to answer the following questions:
1. How does price affect the popularity of a listing?
2. How does available space affect the popularity of a listing?
3. Are there specific keywords in the title that affect the popularity of a listing?
