## Motivation

In this project, we examine the Seattle Airbnb [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) in order to gain insight into factors that affect the popularity of a listing. In particular, we want to answer the following questions:
1. Can we build a linear regression model to accurately predict the popularity of a listing?
2. What are the top characteristics of a listing that impact the popularity of a listing?
3. Are there specific neighborhoods or property types that are preferred in a listing?
